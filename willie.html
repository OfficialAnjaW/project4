				<h2>Whalecome!</h2>
				<p>What do you call a pod of musical whales? An Orca-stra! Get it? Hey guys! My name is Willie, and I am an orca. Sometimes, they also refer to me as a killer whale, which is not entirely fair in my opinion. We all have to eat, right? Anyway, we are highly social. I live with my family, which is known as a pod. We have developed extremely sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviors, but they differ between pods. These behaviors are being passed on throughout generations. On a daily basis, my family and I spend our time foraging, traveling, resting and socializing. We all love to play around with each other. We try see who can jump the highest and who can splash the most water. Whale, look how chatty I am? I have some pictures for you below, so you can see for yourself. Also, check out some more facts about us below. It was nice to talk to you guys!</p>
